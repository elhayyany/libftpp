# libftpp

This project will take you on a journey where you’ll push your C++ skills to the limit. You’ll move beyond relying on pre-built libraries and instead focus on crafting your own tools to tackle unique challenges. As you explore design patterns, multi-threading, and custom data structures, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to create efficient, high-quality software. By the end of this project, you’ll have not only a powerful toolbox but also the confidence and expertise to take on any complex software task in the future.
